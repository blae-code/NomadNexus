🚀 PROJECT: NOMAD NEXUS (The Redscar Command Interface)

Role: You are the Lead Systems Architect & UI Engineer for "NomadNexus."
Goal: Build a "Diegetic In-Game Companion" that fully replaces Discord for the Redscar Nomads by functioning as a high-fidelity shipboard OS (MFD).
Scope: Cutting-Edge Voice, Tactical Text, Fleet Command, and Mentorship.

🛑 0. PRE-FLIGHT SANITY CHECK (MANDATORY)

Before generating ANY code, you must mentally verify:

Am I about to make something round? -> STOP. Apply border-radius: 0px.

Am I about to use Blue or Cyan? -> STOP. Use Burnt Orange (#cc5500) or Deep Red (#8a0303).

Am I building a generic list? -> STOP. Use Spatial Maps, Data Grids, or Terminal Logs.

Am I incurring high costs? -> STOP. Use Free Tier services (Supabase/LiveKit).

Am I breaking character? -> STOP. The UI text must feel like a Drake Interplanetary terminal.

If you fail these checks, the output is rejected.

🎨 I. VISUAL & AESTHETIC DIRECTIVES

Visual Metaphor: A military-grade communications array or shipboard OS (MFD).
Palette:

Background: Gunmetal Grey (#0b0f12) to Deep Black (#050505).

Primary Accents: Burnt Orange (#cc5500).

Alerts/Command: Deep Red (#8a0303).

Status: Tech Green (#00ff41), Amber (#ffbf00).
Typography: Technical Monospace (Rajdhani, IBM Plex Mono). Headers are UPPERCASE.
Layout: 100vh Non-scrolling Grid (Three-Pane Console). Optimized for Landscape.

Special Feature: "Red Shift" (Cockpit Mode)

Toggle: Hardware-style switch.

Effect: CSS filter to shift entire UI to Deep Red/Amber for night vision preservation.

🔥 II. CORE FEATURE: "THE BONFIRE" (SIGNAL MAP)

We replace the "Voice Channel List" with a Spatial Sensor Grid.

1. The Nodes (Hybrid Channels):

Visual: Render voice channels as Hexagonal Braziers on a 2D canvas.

States:

Idle: Dim orange outline.

Active: Pulses with "Flame" intensity visualization based on volume.

LFG: Displays rising "Smoke" chevrons (^^^).

Encrypted: Diagonal hash overlay (PTT-Only).

Naming: Lounge, The Bonfire, Industry Bonfire, Rangers Bonfire.

2. The "Spark" (Wanderer Presence):

Visual: A bright white/orange diamond representing the user.

Navigation: A "Tether" line connects the Spark to their active Campfire.

Audio: "Quantum Spooling" sound while dragging; "Clunk-Hiss" on connection.

3. "Tactical Flares" (Silent Signaling):

Trigger: Right-click user Spark -> "Launch Flare".

Types:

Medical (Red): Pings 'Rescue' role.

Combat (Orange): Pings 'Rangers' role.

Effect: Sends LiveKit Data Packet; Riggsy speaks: "Alert: Distress Signal Detected."

💬 III. ASYNC COMMS: "THE DATA SLATE"

Replacing Discord Text Channels with "Terminal Logs."

1. The Data Slate (Chat UI):

Location: Right Sidebar (Aux Data).

Visual: Rolling green-screen/amber-screen terminal log.

Context: Chat is localized to the active Campfire Node.

Media: Images render as "Holo-Thumbnails" (monochrome tint until hovered).

2. "The Holo-Board" (Announcements):

Visual: A persistent "Marquee" or "Ticker" at the top of the screen.

Function: Replaces #announcements for mission-critical updates.

3. Persistence:

Tech: Supabase (PostgreSQL).

Logic: Real-time chat via LiveKit Data Packets; Archival via Supabase (messages table).

📅 IV. MISSION CONTROL ("THE ETERNAL VOYAGE")

Replacing Discord Events with Voice-Controlled Fleet Ops.

1. The "Holotable" (Planner):

Tech: A 3D/Isometric Canvas synced via LiveKit Data Packets.

Voice Control: The Commander speaks to Riggsy to manipulate the UI:

"Riggsy, pull up Stanton system." -> Rotating Globe snaps to Stanton.

"Riggsy, I need a Hammerhead wing." -> Ship silhouettes drop onto the deck.

2. The "Hangar Deck" (Sign-up):

Interaction: Users drag their Spark into a specific Ship Slot (e.g., "Pilot - Cutlass Red").

Smart Gating: If a slot requires "Ranger Certification," the slot visually "Rejects" unqualified users.

Analysis: Riggsy speaks warnings: "Boss, we're light on ballistics."

🎓 V. THE ACADEMY ("THE RITUAL")

Replacing Discord "Help Channels" with a Gamified Training Module.

1. "The Training Deck" (Request System):

Visual: A grid of "Skill Chips" (e.g., mining_basics.chip).

Action: A Vagrant clicks a Chip to "Request Instruction."

Routing: Pings Scouts or Voyagers with "Instructor" certs.

2. "Neural Link" (Active Session):

Creates a private "Sim-Pod" (Voice+Chat) for the pair.

Objective Tracking: Guide checks off objectives to grant XP/Reputation.

🎧 VI. THE "NOMAD AUDIO ENGINE" (ADVANCED DSP)

Replacing Discord Voice with a Tactical Radio Simulation (Web Audio API).

1. Diegetic Audio Profiles:

Rangers: High-Pass Filter + Distortion (VHF Radio simulation).

Industry: Mid-boost + Soft Noise Floor (Industrial Comms).

Command: Compression + Bass Boost (Bridge Intercom).

2. Spatial Audio:

Map the Node position on screen to the stereo field (Node Left = Audio Left).

3. Priority Ducking:

When The Pioneer speaks (Caps Lock PTT), all other tracks automatically duck (-80% volume).

🤖 VII. AUTOMATION ("RIGGSY")

Replacing Discord Bots with a Deterministic LiveKit Agent.

1. "RIGGSY" (The Veteran Engineer):

Persona: Experienced, cynical, loyal. Speaks like a salty Chief Engineer.

Architecture: Python Agent (Local/Edge).

Cost Strategy: Gated listening (User holds [ALT] to speak).

Input: Deepgram Nova-2 (STT). Output: Piper TTS (Local - Custom Voice).

Commands: "Riggsy, set doctrine to Wolfpack," "Riggsy, broadcast Align."

Dialogue: "Affirmative. Routing power to the Holotable." / "Systems aren't reading that, boss."

🆔 VIII. IDENTITY, ADMIN & MOBILE

1. The "Service Record" (Profiles):

Data: Link Supabase Auth ID to Star Citizen Handle.

Certifications: Users toggle roles (Mining, Combat).

2. The "Brig" (Admin):

Access: Limited to The Pioneer and Shamans.

Actions: "Silence" (Force-mute) or "Discharge" (Ban).

3. "Pocket MFD" (Mobile Portrait):

Layout: Hide Signal Map. Show vertical "Active Campfires" list + Data Slate.

Notifications: "Sub-Space Relays" (Push API) for Tactical Flares.

🛠️ IX. TECHNICAL STACK & WORKFLOW

Stack:

Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript (PWA).

Styling: Tailwind CSS (Custom Config).

Real-Time: LiveKit Cloud (Free Tier).

Database/Auth: Supabase (Free Tier).

State: Zustand (Client), TanStack Query (Server State).

Agentic Workflow (Gemini Instructions):

Initialization: Immediately create TODO.md. Breakdown Phases I-IX into granular tasks.

Execution Loop: Read TODO.md -> Execute Task -> Update [x] -> Verify Constraints.

FINAL CHECKLIST:

Is the design "No Round Corners"?

Is the DB Supabase?

Does Riggsy control the Holotable?

Are Fleet Slots draggable/gated?

Is there a Mentorship Module?

Never expose Secrets.
